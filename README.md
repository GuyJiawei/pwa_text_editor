  ## Description
  This is a text editor that you can use directly in your web browser, designed to work seamlessly with modern web technologies. It's a single-page Progressive Web Application (PWA) that provides redundancy for data persistence in case your browser doesn't support certain options. This means you can rest assured that your data will always be safe and accessible.

  What's more, this text editor is designed to work offline, so you can work on your documents even when you're not connected to the internet.
